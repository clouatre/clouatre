## What I Write → [clouatre.ca](https://clouatre.ca)

- [What a Null Result Taught Us About AI Agent Evaluation](https://clouatre.ca/posts/prompt-repetition-agent-evaluation) — We tested prompt repetition on 20 parallel AI agents. The null result is a finding about evaluation design.
- [Why Your AI Agent Failed in Production](https://clouatre.ca/posts/ai-observability-gaps) — Missing decision provenance, not metrics. The 3 observability gaps traditional monitoring won't catch.
- [RAG for Legacy Systems: 7,432 Pages to 3s Answers](https://clouatre.ca/posts/rag-legacy-systems) — Model-agnostic reranking, no vendor lock-in, validated across 4 LLM families.
